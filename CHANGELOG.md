# 20211122 - sketch and deploy process

I make a simple website in the src folder that implements a homepage in the main naviservers domain
This home page consults the forcast API and gets a quote from the firebase service. Also, it shows the current date and time.

The compilation will be done using dockerfile. It allows the use of the Docker public registry and facilitates the deployment on the navi server.

Additionally, a Kubernetes deployment file is available that runs pods, a service, and external access through the ingress module.

# 20211121 - Initialization

I initialize basic documentation.
